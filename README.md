# 🚀 Day 2 of the Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge Completed!
Today, I transformed my AI agent into a Coffee Shop Barista ☕ — capable of taking voice-based coffee orders, asking clarifying questions, and generating a full JSON summary of the final order.
The agent now:
- ✔ Maintains an order state
- ✔ Asks smart follow-up questions
- ✔ Saves the final order to a JSON file
- ✔ Uses Murf Falcon — the fastest TTS API for real-time voice responses
- ✔ Runs fully in the browser using LiveKit

This challenge is levelling up my skills with real-time audio, stateful agents, and voice interactions!
Excited for Day 3! ⚡🔥
